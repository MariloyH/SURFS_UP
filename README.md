# SURFS_UP
BootCamp Data Analysis Week9: SQL &amp; Flask

# Overview
Previuosly, we made a Weather Analysis in the province of O'ahu, Hawaii with the purpose of showing projections to future prospects, willing to invest in a small ice cream business and surf equipment rental. Now they have asked us to repeat the projections specifically of the temperature history for the months of June and December. Again we will take the data stored in a SQL database to be able to show it to future business partners.

# Results: 
**Historical June temperarures**

From this stats, we can observe that:
  1. The average temperature in this months are between 71 and 74 °F, that is the year´s average.
  2. The maximum temperature is very similar in the  two months, 83 and 85 °F.
  3. The minimun temperature in December is 56 °F, maybe to cold for an ice cream!

 # Summary
From the data collected, we can observe that both June and December are excellent months to visit O'ahu, taking advantage of the holidays! It should be considered that in December, temperatures decreases to 56° F, perhaps too cold to eat ice cream! but maybe the weather its suitable for surfing.  I propose two additional queries that could give us more information about how convenient are these months: one that shows us the statistics of rainfall, and another that shows us the average number of rainy days in June and December.
