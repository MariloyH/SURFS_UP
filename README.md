Deliverable 3 Instructions
For this part of the Challenge, write a report that describes the key differences in weather between June and December and two recommendations for further analysis.

The analysis should contain the following:
# Overview
Previuosly, we made a Weather Analysis in the province of O'ahu, Hawaii with the purpose of showing projections to future prospects, willing to invest in a small ice cream business and surf equipment rental. Now they have asked us to repeat the projections specifically of the temperature history for the months of June and December. Again we will take the data stored in a SQL database to be able to show it to future business partners.

# Results: 
**Historical June temperarures

From this stats tables, we can observe that:
  1. The average temperature in this months are between 71 and 74 °F, that is the year average.
  2. The maximum temperature is very similar in the  two months, 83 and 85 °F.
  4. The minimun temperature is quite different, it´s 
  5. sProvide a bulleted list with three major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.
Summary: Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional queries that you would perform to gather more weather data for June and December.
